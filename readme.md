WARNING: THIS IS IN BETA STAGE AND NOT ALL THE LINKS CURRENTLY WORK, MORE LINKS AND BUG FIXES TO COME!

Vitoal is a free tool I've created to help get around school malware. Vitoal is a compiled list of useful tools for computers at your School. This is mainly just a list of useful information and websites that should be unblocked for most school computers. Things in here can help you get around school malware, unblock extensions, etc.

Vitoal is completely free to use as long as you do not steal anything without giving credit to me. However you are allowed to download the repository and add your own useful links to the HTML file and reupload it on GitHub. (just give credit to me)
